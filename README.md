## Hii! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Simen, 
25 years old, on my spare time I play video games, lift slightly heavy things, and enjoy a good book or two.

Decided to up my geek level so I could get a job within IT, and Frontend development seemed like a fun place to start, so here we are!

You can reach me on:

- Discord - pocket369
- Facebook - Simen Magnussen
- Email - simen.magnussen@outlook.com

Fun fact: I am red/green/brown, blue/purple, and pink/grey color blind, can you tell? :D
